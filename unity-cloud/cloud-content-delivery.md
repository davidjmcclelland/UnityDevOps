# Cloud Content Delivery

Access Cloud Content Delivery from the Products menu on the Left.

When first launched it will show an overview like the DevOps did. Click Launch in the overview page to load the Product Details page where you can purchase a free tier of the service.

The purchase is mapped to an organization. Therefore, if one organization has been created to contain a project, that is the organization to be selected. Financial infomration is required to be given at this stage because if the free tier threshold is exceeded in the defined period it converts to a paygo plan.
