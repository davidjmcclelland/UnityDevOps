# Unity Asset Manager

Unity Asset Manager must be linked to a specific project. Once enabled, when 3D assets are ingested metadata and geometry will be used to help a team find and interact with assets in various useful ways.

In addition, some Unity content is exposed, including some demos.

Assets purchased from Unity Store are automatically placed in Asset Manager as well.
