# Team Setup

Teams are created by invitation from Version Control.

The team member(s) that are invited receive an email inviting them to login with their email address and access the project. The email does not always contain a link to the project.

In any case the invitee can log into Unity and access the project as shown in the following:

Once switched over to the organization they were invited to, the entire Unity Cloud UI provides access within that organization's context:
