# Team Setup

Unity is in a state of transition where it comes to defining members of a team, which makes setting up a team somewhat more complicated and confusing than it should be.

Fundamentally, teams are created based the concept of Seats. Seats equate to concurrent users within an organization. This is what defines what is purchased from Unity. Before additional users can be added to a project they must be added under the Seats table located in the DevOps Version Control section in Unity Cloud.

Seats can only be allocated to users who have been added to organization members. I invited another user account to my test project, so they appear in the dropdown. Normally, it would be expected that adding a user would begin at "Seats" but until Unity figures out how to integrate their user definitions and databases, this is where the confusion starts.

Teams are created by invitation from Version Control.

The team member(s) that are invited receive an email inviting them to login with their email address and access the project. The email does not always contain a link to the project.

In any case the invitee can log into Unity and access the project as shown in the following:

Once switched over to the organization they were invited to, the entire Unity Cloud UI provides access within that organization's context:
