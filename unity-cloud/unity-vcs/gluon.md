# Gluon

Gluon is UVCS with any option that would lead to the need to merge changes turned off. Gluon is for large BLOBs that must be locked while someone has it checked out for editing. There is no merging binaries - only one artist at a time can work on them. Simple.&#x20;

Note that this is something GiT does not do, or if it does, it isn't a friendly, confidence inspiring experience for anyone involved.
