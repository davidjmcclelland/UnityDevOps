# Unity Cloud

The first time a new user enters the dashboard they will be prompted for some demographic information to help set up their experience. The dashboard will seem pretty empty since there will be no projects and nothing to go on the board.

It is possible to create a project in the dashboard to get started. Or a project can be started in Unity Editor. It is even possible to create a project in one and link it to an existing project in the other.

Clicking on Products in the Left menu will bring up some of the service options cloud offers. DEVOPS category is useful right from the start. Select Version Control and Build Automation. Launch it. It will prompt to Create Project, as this is required to start using it.

Download the UVCS Application from the dropdown.

When you click Create Project the page will redraw and you will see a YouTube Video preview and an overview of the DevOps service. There are a bunch of links to resources and support on the Right side. What is not visible is a newly created project, which is weird.

Look on the Left menu and you will see that a DevOps shortcut is now shown beneath the main 4 menu selections. It is selected, and the top submenu entry, named Overview, is what is shown in the main window.

Click Explore Repositories and the rest of the submenu entries. You will see that the UVCS entries flashes an Access Required screen. UVCS requires that even a free-level individual account create an organization in order to create repositories. This is because repositories typically belong to some entity, such as a company. Companies assign users to work on their games by adding them to repositories. Every tier has to follow the model.

Eventually you will click on Unity Cloud Drive. This feature will provide a helpful button to create an organization. Do that now.

A note reads "The server location is reused for all repositories and CANNOT be changed once configured." There is a workaround if this setting becomes a problem. Generally Unity Cloud is a CDN, so the impact of a bad selection here is for initial uploads of content.

Once an organization has been created, returning to the DevOps Overview submenu will show an onboarding experience in place of the YouTube content that was shown before.

Follow the first two steps to get a repository created, and assign UVCS to be the VC tool to connect it with. A repository can contain multiple projects. If a project and a repository have the same name it will look like "myProjectName/myProjectName" so it is a good idea to map the repository name to a higher level than individual project scope.&#x20;

For step two, click the drop down and select Unity Version Control. Accept Default server URL. Then Save:
