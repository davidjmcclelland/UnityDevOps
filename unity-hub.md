Hub tracks multiple versions of Unity that may be installed.

Unity is referred to as an engine because a portion of the runtime code is shared between the engine and any content produced using it. They are paired.

Hub can pair up a project with the version of the engine used to create it. This is essential to allow developers to release non-breaking patches for released products.

In the example shown, the project was created using version 2020.3.27f1. That version of the engine is installed to allow work to be done on the project without requiring it to be updated.
