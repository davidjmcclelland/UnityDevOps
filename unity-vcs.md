# Unity VCS

Run the installer for Unity DevOps Version Control that should have already been downloaded in an earlier step. Once installed, launch it and pick from the 2 choices shown. I always choose the Left side.

You will need to log into Unity again to use the UVCS. Again, it makes sense that a developer can work form multiple companies from the same UVCS instance, so this should map to the Cloud account you intend to access. Click on the option to log in using your Unity account and it will bring up your repository instantly.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Click the Settings button on the upper Right to open the UVCS preferences, pick Other Options, change Default Workspace to $HOME/workspaces or whatever location makes sense.
{% endhint %}

If UVCS is not working out for your use case, access the same preferences button and select "Switch to Gluon".
